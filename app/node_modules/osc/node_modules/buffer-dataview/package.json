Node.js already\ncomes with a DataView implementation, but it only works with `ArrayBuffer`\ninstances, and not Node's preferred `Buffer` type. This is mostly useful when\nre-using previously written code which interacts with `DataView` instances\nrather than Node.js Buffers.\n\nThe `DataView` instances simply proxy the invoked instance method to the\nequivalent [Buffer API][] call.\n\nNote that the `buffer` property of the `DataView` instance is the Node.js `Buffer`\ninstance, and _not_ a converted `ArrayBuffer` or something else like that. There's\nno copying that happens here, it's just a \"view\"...\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nInstall with `npm`:\n\n``` bash\n$ npm install buffer-dataview\n```\n\n\nExample\n-------\n\n``` js\nvar DataView = require('buffer-dataview');\n\nvar buffer = new Buffer(4);\nvar view = new DataView(buffer);\n\n// set a \"float\" in the data view\nview.setFloat32(0, 1337.1234, true);\n\n// ensure that the original Buffer was modified\nconsole.log(buffer.readFloatLE(0));\n// → 1337.1234130859375\n```\n\n\nLicense\n-------\n\n(The MIT License)\n\nCopyright (c) 2013 Nathan Rajlich &lt;nathan@tootallnate.net&gt;\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\n'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\nthe following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED 'AS IS', WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.\nIN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY\nCLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT,\nTORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE\nSOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.\n\n[DataView]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Typed_arrays/DataView\n[Buffer API]: http://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/buffer.html\n",
